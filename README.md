# A Simple J2EE 8 JAX-RS Example Server Application

Intended to be used as the "Hello World" starting point for an actual JAX-RS application.
It does not include authentication/authorization, nor does it include JPA or other techniques
for integrating with a larger application.  I.e., it simply demonstrates JAX-RS.

This application was developed in NetBeans 9.0 and tested with Payara 5.
